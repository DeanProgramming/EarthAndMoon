# Earth and Moon Visualization App

Earth and Moon is an interactive project developed using Three.js, a JavaScript library for 3D rendering. The project showcases an immersive visualization of the Earth and Moon system.

## Features

- Realistic 3D rendering of Earth and Moon with distinctive textures and details.
- Dynamic rotation of objects along their axes for a realistic visual representation.
- Moon orbits the Earth at a slight angle, adding to the overall authenticity of the simulation.
- Interactive functionality using raycasting for an engaging user experience.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) displays relevant information when hovering over the planet.
- Unique planet selection feature with vector math to maintain a fixed distance from the camera.
- Modular and extensible design for easy addition of more planets in the future.

## Interactive Functionality

The application utilizes raycasting to detect mouse interaction, providing users with relevant information through a GUI. This interactive feature enhances the exploration and learning experience as users navigate the planetary bodies.

## Unique Planet Selection

Users can select planets, and the application ensures that the selected planet maintains a fixed distance from the camera, regardless of its rotation. This functionality allows users to explore the selected planet from various angles and perspectives.

## Modular and Extensible Design

The codebase is structured in a generic fashion, facilitating easy addition of more planets in the future. The modular design ensures that the application can accommodate future expansions and additions without significant modifications to the existing code.

## Getting Started

To run the Earth and Moon app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DeanProgramming/EarthAndMoon.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Launch the app by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Dependencies

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - JavaScript 3D library.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the Three.js community for their powerful 3D rendering library.

By leveraging Three.js and implementing interactive features, this project provides an immersive and educational experience for users to explore and learn about the Earth and Moon system. The modular design further enhances the project's scalability and potential for future enhancements.
